dtp	eng	Nokoilo oku dot amu ii miloh popoginawo tulun kumaa diya. Nunu poh mangan nga mumbal dumadi songulun ii kobingginawaan. Suai nopo om diolo nopo toilaan. Nokoilo oku songkuro poh koginawaanku nga ii wokon amu koilo monuli. Om iri nopo nga okon ko kowion diti pomogunan. Nokoilo oku dot monontoun ii poposuni kotumbayaan om kokirop no mamaraag. Iri no okon ko nunu ii haro doid koposion nu nga isai poingampai. 	I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them. I learned that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back. And it's not the end of the world. I've learned that it takes years to build up trust and only seconds to destroy it. That it's not what you have in your life but who you have in your life that counts.
